# Comparison of databases

### MongoDB

- Represents data as of JSON documents

- You don't need to define the schema

- Doesn't support JOIN

- JavaScript as query language

- Ideal choice if you have unstructured and/or structured data with the potential for rapid growth

### MySQL

- Represents data in tables and rows

- You need to define your tables and columns

- Supports JOIN operations

- Uses the Structured Query Language (SQL)

- Great choice if you have structured data and need a traditional relational database
