# IP Configuration

### Static IP address

- = an address that doesn't **change** (generally used by servers or important equipment)

-  Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

- **Advantages**: better DNS support, server hosting, convenient remote access, more reliable communcation, more reliable geo-location services

- **Disadvantages**: More hackable, higher cost, real-world security concerns

### Dynamic IP address

- An address **can change**

- Used because IPv4 doesn't provide enough static IP addresses to go around

- Assign by ISP's DHCP server

- Standard user for consumer equipment
