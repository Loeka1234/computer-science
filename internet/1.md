# Internet

IP-Adress (internet protocol adress): #.#.#.#

- 4 numbers

- Each number is a value between 0 and 255

- Uniquely identifies other computers on the internet

---

**DHCP**: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: Software that ISPs (Internet Serivce Providers) run to provide an IP to a host.

**DNS** (domain name system) servers: Converts domain names to corresponding IP adresses.

PORTS:

- Examples:
  
  - 80: HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol)
  
  - 443: SSL
  
  - 25: Email
  
  - ...

- Used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network by specifying both the host, and the service.

**Protocol**: 

- An established **set of rules** that determine how data is **transmitted** between different devices in the same network.

- Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Ensures that packets can get to their destination

- Supports sequence numbers: ensures data gets to its intended destination

**Difference** UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP

- **UDP** <u>does not guarantee</u> delivery of packets
  
  - For example: video chat, live video, etc.

- **TCP** <u>does guarantee</u> delivery of packets 
  
  - For example: movies, etc.
  
  - They do tend to buffer as you don't want to miss a few seconds or a minute of a movie

The world is **running out** of IP addresses:

- IPv4 (32-bit IP adress) --> IPv6 (128-bit IP address)
